        <h3>What does javascript event loop do?</h3>
        <p>We know javascripts runs on both server and the browser. In the inside of the browsers v8 engine, there're
            heap and call stack. Heap is basically used for memory management. And when functions are being called they
            goes to the call stack. Funcions are basically categorized as stack at the call stack. When the file gets
            the first javascript he creates a global context on the browser and whenever he gets a function he puts it
            to the call stack and then the function will run its codes line by line (say syncronous). if he gets another
            function inside
            of the function he's running he will put it to the stack again and then execute that very function which he
            got just now.It's like Last come First Serve. But if he gets an asyncronous function(setTimeOut() etc) he
            will transfer it to the queue. And after completing the stack then the functions stored in queue will
            execute. And the process how javascript realizes that he needs to execute the queued functions, is called
            The Event Loop</p>


        <h3>Deferences between local and session storage.</h3>
        <p>
            Local storage is for for longer use. In the other hand session storage is temporary. If a user
            closes a tab the session storage will be gone too.
            It means If a page reloads or closes or reopens, session storage will remove as well. But local storage
            won't.
            But both storage can be removed by the user. If a user needs to remember some information which he can
            reuse
            later, preferable choice is, local storage. A user can store data which he can reuse, maybe later. Like,
            user email and password to log in. Which he can reuse later to sign in again. Or to use some data or
            calculations again where he left before closing the tab. He can starts where he left. He doesn't need to do
            it from the very beginning.
